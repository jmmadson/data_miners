# Visualization Plan
Our goal is to use an interactive dashboard to show how electric vehicle infrastructure, along with other factors, contributes to electric vehicle adoption within a geographical area.  With interactivity, one can explore how adjustments to various factors effects the number of registered electric vehicles.  Currently, we have extracted, transformed, and loaded data for 7 states. 

## Tableau
We have created several visualizations using Tableau and will narrow down to those that help tell the story best. Using filters and other interactive elements available, users will be able to see how various factors affect the number of Electric Vehicles on the road. Additionally, our Machine Learning model will create predictions based on adjustments to the various features that are part of the model.  These predictions can then be used to assist in making infrastructure decisions to increase EV adoption.

### Data to Focus On
Below are various factors that could be used to analyze the data, as well as factors that could be changed in order to increase the number of EVs on the road. So far, we have incorporated the first six into our data and dashboard.

- Registration by Zip
- Charging Stations by Zip
- Median Income by Zip
- Households by Zip (per Household data)
- Type of Charger
- Type of EV Network
- State Incentives/Laws
- ML Predictions



### Connect ML to Tableau
Because we are using the free version of Tableau, we will not be able to connect directly to the database.  CSVs will be created, then loaded into Tableau to create the visualizations and interactive dashboard.  This will limit the actual analysis we can perform in the time that we have, but the possibility for more real-time predictions is there. 

## Git Pages
Git Pages will be used to host our dashboard.
