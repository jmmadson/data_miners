## Overview:
-------------
The focus of this folder(database_related) is to store the database related files

The two sql files are used to create the schema/tables and columns in PGADMIN. One file contains the primary and foreign key relationships whereas in the other the relationships are dropped and the the table structures are more normalized.

The three html files are the result of data profiling package. The file contains data profile results on each and every column, it shows the uniqueness, missing data, skewed data, distinct etc. The files are dynamic in nature and can be extended/collapsed anyway needed. The data modeling was done based on the analysis from these profiles(which columns to keep, transformed and which to drop).

The 'Schema_Text' file contains the structure for ERD and if it needs to be recreated then the file can be used. We used the following site to create the ERD(Entity Relationship Diagram): https://app.quickdatabasediagrams.com/

The 'ERD' file is the visual depict of our data model and generated from https://app.quickdatabasediagrams.com/

'SQL's to validate data' is the sample sql file that can be used to check the data loads, read data or join data

'Table_structure' file was generated from https://app.quickdatabasediagrams.com/ as well, it display table level data in more details.
